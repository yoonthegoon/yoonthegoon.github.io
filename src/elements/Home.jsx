## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my page.

## About me

I'm a software engineer who's worked in networking, cybersecurity, web development, and more.
If you'd like to learn more about my professional skills and experiences, find out more [here.](/about)
But enough about the boring stuff.

I love astronomy and astrophotography (though I may not be so good at it). Another thing I love that I'm not so good at is martial arts.
I've trained in Muay Thai and would like to soon pick up Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Watching freestyle wrestling, boxing, and mixed martial arts is always fun.
I also enjoy fighting games, such as the Street Fighter series.

However, I'm not all about violence. During the winter, I love to go snowboarding with my friends.
I think I could go on about all the interests I have, but I think that's better to save for conversation.
